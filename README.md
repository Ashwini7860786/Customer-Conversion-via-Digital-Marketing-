To Develop a Binary Classification Model to Predict Customer Conversion Through Digital Marketing Interactions
•	The dataset contains information about 8000 customers' demographics, campaign interactions, and conversion rates in a digital marketing campaign.
•	Data Preprocessing: Null value treatment, outlier detection, and multicollinearity checks, and conducted feature engineering to create new variables like conversion_rate, cpa, ctr, and avg_transaction_value relevant to the business problem.
•	Addressed dataset imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).
•	Models Used: Applied multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, RandomForest and XGBoost.
•	-Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for optimal model performance
performance.
•	Toolset: : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE.
